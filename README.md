# My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This repository documents my journey of learning Python, day by day, showcasing what I have learned, practiced, and created. I hope this serves as a useful reference for others embarking on a similar path.

## Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: [21 January 2025]

#### What I Did:
- Installed Python and set up my development environment.
- Learned basic syntax, including:
  - Printing to the console:
    ```python
    print("Hello World!")
    print("Hello World!\nHello Boss\nHello Bro")
    print("Hello" + " " + "Luthfi")
    ```
- Learned how to ask for user input and combine it with output:
  ```python
  input("What is your name?")
  print("hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")
  ```
- Stored input in variables and performed operations:
  ```python
  name = input("what is your name?")
  print(name)
  username = input("what is your username?")
  length = len(username)
  print(length)
  ```
- Created a small project:
  ```python
  print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator")
  city_name = input("What is the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
  pet_name = input("What is your pet's name?\n")
  print(f"Your band name could be {city_name} {pet_name}")
  ```

#### Challenges:
- Understanding the syntax for combining strings and inputs.
- Remembering to add spaces between concatenated strings.

#### Reflections:
- I enjoyed seeing immediate results from my code and creating something interactive.
- Tomorrow, I want to focus on writing cleaner and more organized code.
